#' Save to results
#'
#' Saves the desired output to a results file in the current working
#' directory. Output saved in this file can later be compiled as a document.
#' @param output.object Any object. The output to be saved. Most often you want
#'     this to be a character vector of length 1, why you will see a warning if
#'     it is something else. No default.
#' @param object.name Character vector of length 1. The name of the output
#'     object in the results object. No default.
#' @param overwrite Logical vector of length 1. If TRUE any entry in the results
#'     object with the same name as object.name is overwritten. Defaults to
#'     TRUE.
#' @export
